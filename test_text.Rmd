# My very own test doc

Hello, there. I am a text document containing
the following cx matrix. Notice, that it is essentially a code block:

    <cx>
        <nobox>
            [
                [[gf=adv][prag=[df=muu]][sem=aika,muutos]]
                [[gf=subj]]
                [[cat=V]]
                [[gf=compl]]
            ]
        </nobox>
    </cx>

Now this document continues with a lot of important
remarks left. Let us start by noting that the sun is shining.
